## Hey, welcome to my profile!

### I do full-stack development, but...
- My main languages are TypeScript and PHP, but I'm also confident in C# 😸😸
- I'm based in Germany 🇩🇪
- My area of expertise are web applications
- I'm getting into managing infrastructure, DevOps and data analysis/machine learning to expand my skillset 😡😡
- My daily driver is Arch Linux but I also have exp with Mint/Ubuntu, so I know my way around with most servers and containers
---
### Other stuff about me
- My timezone is `CET (Central European Time) UTC/GMT+1` 🕥
- I really like listening to K-Pop (I love aespa) and [watching K-Dramas (check out my MyDramaList!)](https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/fx_ntmm) ✨
- In my free time I usually enjoy going out to walks with my friends and talking with them
- I occassionally play games as well, but I sort of grew out of my gaming phase 😭
